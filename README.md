## Installation
This real estate is a fullstack project and it provides two main components:

1. **Frontend: React - TypeScript - Tailwind CSS**
2. **Backend: Node.js - JavaScript - Express.js**

You have the option to run each part separately or both locally.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. To run the frontend locally:

```bash
cd vite-project
```
```javascript
npm install
```
```javascript
npm run dev
```

## Backend

The backend utilizes Node.js, JavaScript, and Express.js as the framework. To run the backend locally:

```bash
cd api
```
Having entired the api directory, it is now time to add your secret files
Create an .env file and have the following names 
```bash
Mongo_Uri = 
Jwt_Secret_Key = 
clientID = 
clientSecret = 
NODE_ENV = production || development
```
Now you can go ahead to the rest of the process, and get the api up and runing by using the following commands
```javascript
npm install
```
```javascript
npm run server
```




## Run Both Locally

If you want to run both the frontend and backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Run the frontend as mentioned above.
2. In a separate terminal, run the backend:

```bash
cd either directory
```
```javascript
npm install
```
```javascript
npm run server or run dev
```

Adjust the directory paths and commands based on your project structure. Happy coding!
